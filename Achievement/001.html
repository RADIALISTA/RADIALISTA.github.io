It was all digital! So they gave us chromebooks! (Well, mine I bought to be honest… I don't want to have something that isn’t technically mine, you know?) So when i was bored I just started programing and F*** off school! (I don't recommend doing this if you want to have good grades at school, of course!)"];

This is a small project that I started making while I was in my second year at high school. It's supposed to be like an “ideas dump”! Made just for sharing ideas and most important: Learn more coding! I also have plans for making a portfolio with this…</p>
