                            <p>&emsp; Honestly, I’m not at my 100% potential right now… But since my last message lots of things have happened! Some great, some worse, but I am more engaged in doing stuff. (But my grades at school still suck! :D) <br />
                               &emsp; I am finishing the “Hall of Achievements “ and soon I will add more stuff to it! Also, I have reorganized the folders of the website, and tweaked some minor things. Well, I guess I will try to publish more videos to my YouTube channel. See ya next time! <3</p>

                            <p>&emsp; I don't know… Every now and then people are in a bad mood, but I am worried about myself. I feel this is like a downgrade! I am feeling more lonely and more improductive. Also, I made some little changes here! I added “birds” ! Kind of… These flying eyes have a random chance to spawn and you can click them. I will do a prettier counter later… For now that's it! Nothing really special is happening these days… I hope you are having a great time! ^^</p>

                            <h2>12/09/2023 - The VHS project</h2>
                            <p>&emsp; A while ago I made a TV head project, 
                                and now I want to make a video on YouTube explaining how I did it.
                                But I was wondering, can I use a VHS?
                                So I gathered all of my old electronics and got a VCR from my old grandma’s house:
                                </p>
                            <span>
                                &emsp;<img id="Vcr" src="assets/Blog_Images/vcr_ctr.jpg">
                                <p>It isn't a big project, it's more like an optional part of a big project.
                                    Now I'm waiting for the rest of the components to be delivered.<br />
                                    Next step is to build a Video Glitch Mixer.
                                    I hope this dont get more expensive than it already is...
                                    <br /><br />
                                    Welp, i got to go! It's 10 AM and I need to buy some stuff, see ya!
                                </p>
                            </span>
                            
                            <!-- 2  -->
                            <h2>12/08/2023 - Navigator added!</h2>
                            <p>&emsp; Yesterday I did nothing on the website because I was doing french class homework. Anyways, today I added a navigator! It will be a little empty for a while… For now I will just use the “PopUp.html” file as a placeholder. Maybe I still need to organize my code better, but I will see about that later! See you soon! (No one is really reading this right now… I think i'm insane! lol)</p>

                            <p>&emsp;Today is a good day! I'm finally free from the duties of going to school in the morning! (At least for a while…) Now I can focus on my personal projects like this website! At the moment I don't have a host provider, but I will find a way to put this website on air. Until that I will use this “blogs” as an update log! Good bye!</p>
